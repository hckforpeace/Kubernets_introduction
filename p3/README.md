# k3d

## What is k3d ?

k3d is a lightweight wrapper to run k3s (Rancher Labâ€™s minimal Kubernetes distribution) in docker.

k3d makes it very easy to create single- and multi-node k3s clusters in docker, e.g. for local development on Kubernetes.

# Commands



``` bash
k3d cluster create my-cluster

```
* Creates a kubernetes cluster inside a container.
* Spin Up a Server Node
* Set up a Load Balancer
* Configure Your kubeconfig

### Check what you created :

docker ps
```

``` bash 
kubectl get nodes
```

``` bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```
